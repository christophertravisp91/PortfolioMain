    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div id="About Me" class="About Me"></div>
    <p>Hello future employers! My name is Christopher Pierce. I am a current student in the Ohio State University Coding Bootcamp. Previously I have been employed as a restaurant worker holding multiple titles, prep-cook, kitchen lead, and manager. Currently I am employed by Toshiba as a repair technician where I repair commercial electronics. I am taking this course as a way to make my way into a more challenging and fulfilling career. I believe this new skill I am developing, as well as the leadership and organizational skills I have from my previous jobs, will make me a well rounded candidate for any web development position.</p>

        <p>This is the first project I created for class. We were given some code and needed to find the errors and correct them so that this company had a fully functioning website.</p>
